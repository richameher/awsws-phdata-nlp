For a low-budget black comedy this is a unwatchable mess with no redeeming values. Despite the title the movie takes place in the couple's dining room,kitchen,and the living room and the front cover has nothing to do with this movie because it is not a slasher flick but a bizarre soap opera-ish movie that looks like a Lifetime movie.\"\r\n",

For a low-budget black comedy this is a unwatchable mess with no redeeming values. Despite the title the movie takes place in the couple's dining room,kitchen,and the living room and the front cover has nothing to do with this movie because it is not a slasher flick but a bizarre soap opera-ish movie that looks like a Lifetime movie.\"]             \n",
